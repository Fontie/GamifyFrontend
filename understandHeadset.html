        <h2>Preparation and safety instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Good preparation is important for a comfortable and safe VR
          experience.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Preparing your space</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide a clear, well-lit area free of obstacles on the floor or
            nearby (such as furniture, pets, or objects).
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure there is enough space, especially when using Roomscale, so
            that you can move around safely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Virtual boundaries help you stay in your activity space to avoid
            collisions with objects in the physical world while you are in your
            virtual environment.
          </li>
          <div class="image1"><img src="images/space.png" alt="space"></div>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Health and safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            VR can cause dizziness or fatigue. Take frequent breaks, especially
            during long sessions. Start with a maximum usage period of 30
            minutes, and then take a break of 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <div class="image"><img src="images/image2.png" alt=""></div>
          <li>
            Beware of “VR nausea” (motion sickness) with intense games. Start
            with less intense experiences if you are prone to nausea.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you wear glasses, wear a suitable glasses-insert if necessary, or
            adjust the headset for the correct fit.
          </li>
          <div class="image"><img src="images/image3.png" alt=""></div>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Display comfort ratings:</h3>
        <p>
          The Meta Quest Store features comfort ratings that help you understand
          how comfortable an app is to use and how likely it is to cause motion
          sickness, depending on your needs and level of experience with virtual
          content.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Comfortable:</strong> Comfort experiences generally avoid
            camera movement, player movement, or disorienting content and
            effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Average:</strong> Average experiences may contain some
            camera movement, player movement, or occasionally disorienting
            content and effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intense:</strong> Intense experiences involve significant
            camera movement, player movement, or disorienting content and
            effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not classified:</strong> Unclassified experiences are not
            rated, but may contain intense content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you experience motion sickness, dizziness, or other negative
          effects, discontinue the experience and try another experience that is
          appropriate for your comfort level.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Setting the Eye distance (IPD)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Quest 3 has an adjustable IPD (Interpupillary Distance) so that
            the lenses are properly adjusted to the distance between your eyes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the IPD using the slider on the bottom of the headset until
            the image is sharp and comfortable.
          </li>

      <!-- 2. Basic Settings for Comfort & Image Quality -->
      <section id="basic-settings">
        <h2>Basic settings for comfort and image quality</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few adjustments that make the VR experience more
          enjoyable, especially for beginners.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Adjust Brightness and Volume</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adjust the brightness of the image for comfortable viewing,
            especially in different lighting conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the volume buttons on the side of the headset to adjust the
            sound level.
          </li>
          <div class="image"><img src="images/image5.png" alt=""></div>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Enable Virtual Hand Tracking (optional)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Quest 3 supports hand tracking as an alternative to the
            controllers, which can be useful for simple interactions and
            navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hand tracking can be activated via
            <code>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Hands &amp; Controllers</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Adjust Fit and Comfort</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure the headband fits snugly to reduce pressure on your face
            and head. The Quest 3 offers an adjustable strap that you can adjust
            for optimal fit and comfort.
          </li>
          <div class="image"><img src="images/image6.png" alt=""></div>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sunlight can cause permanent damage to the lenses, do not use
            outdoors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not use alcohol wipes to clean the headset, as this can damage
            the headset. Instead, you can use non-alcoholic, antibacterial
            wipes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. Switching the Headset On & Off -->
      <section id="power-cycle">
        <h2>Switching the headset on and off:</h2>

        <div class="image"><img src="images/image7.png" alt=""></div>

        <h3>Power On</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Charge: Make sure your Meta Quest 3 is fully charged before you
            begin.

          <li>
            Power On: Press and hold the power button on the side of the headset
            until you see the Meta logo on the screen. The headset will then
            power on.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Power off</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Power off: Press the power button until a menu appears on the
            screen.
          </li>
          <li>Confirm: Select the Power off option and confirm.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> You can also put the Quest to sleep by briefly
          pressing the power button. This saves battery when you are not using
          the headset for a while.

      <section id="controllers">
        <h2>Using the Controllers and Button Functions:</h2>

        <p>
          The Meta Quest 3 controllers are equipped with buttons and sensors to
          accurately track your movements. They work together with the headset
          to create an immersive VR experience.

        <h3>Controller Layout</h3>
        <p>
          Each hand has its own controller: a right controller and a left
          controller. They both have similar buttons, with some specific
          functions for each hand. Start with the left controller, press the
          button with the 3 lines. Then on the right controller, press the

            <strong>Auto Prompt:</strong> When starting up, the Meta Quest 3
            will usually automatically prompt you to set up a play area.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose Boundary Type:</strong> You can choose between
            Stationary (a fixed spot, good for sitting) or Roomscale (a larger
            play area for movement).
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Stationary:</strong> Choose this option if you're

        <p>
          For an optimal first experience, it is helpful to guide users through
          the initial setup.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Wi-Fi Connection Setup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To download apps and update the headset, the Quest 3 must be
            connected to a Wi-Fi network. Make sure you have a stable internet
            connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            During startup, you will be prompted to set up Wi-Fi. Follow the
            on-screen steps to select your network and enter your password.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Create or Log in to Meta Account</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Meta account is required to use the Meta Quest 3. Create an
            account or log in with an existing account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Children under 13 may require a parental
            control account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Firmware Updates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check for updates during setup. Firmware updates ensure that your

        <h2>Account and privacy settings:</h2>
        <p>
          Especially for new users, it is important to know how their privacy is
          protected in the VR environment.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Privacy Settings View</h3>

            You can also set restrictions for certain apps and content, which is
            useful for shared use of the Quest.

        </ul>

        <h3>2. Parental Controls</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For children, parents can set administrative settings to customize
            the VR experience and filter out inappropriate content. This can be
            done via the parental control account in the Meta or Oculus app.
